# Silly Story Generator

A beautiful (and slightly more functional) version of the silly story generator assessment provided by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator)

## Features

- If a name is present in the text field, the protagonist's name in the story is replaced with this name.
- Although, there are validation rules for the text field, they only serve to change the border color of the field to red, to indicate something is wrong. (Implementing code to prevent form submision in case validation fails was out of scope for this assessment).
- By default, U.S. imperial units are selected; however, if the user selects the U.K. metric units, all numbers and units based on imperial units are converted and replaced to metric units.
- A random story is generated each time the generate button is clicked, by replacing placeholder symbols in a fixed story with random lines from multiple arrays.
